## About
Hey! This project is a recipe website based off the "How to cook Christmas Dinner for an Alien" video by Will McDaniel. Linked to the video and channel provided at the bottom.

This project uses three recipes from the video above, the flesh nut roast, the human hand veggie, and the baked seven leg parasite, which are really appetizing for aliens!

## Reflection
Although I already knew a lot of html from prior knowledge, I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to commit through both the command line and vscode, how to use atomic commits with the conventional commits structure, how to rebase and squash your commits so you don't have too many micro commits while pushing in the end, how to commit parts of changed files with "stage selected range," how to separate previously squashed commits by using edit in rebase, and how to change commit descriptions with rebase and reword.
